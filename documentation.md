## 4.0 IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

### 4.1 Introduction

The implementation phase of the Campus Security Management Platform (CSMP) involved the systematic development of all system components using Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, and JSON file-based storage technologies as outlined in the methodology chapter. This chapter presents the detailed technical execution of the campus security management system, including database development, user interface creation, backend functionality implementation, and security measure deployment. The implementation process followed established web development practices while addressing the specific requirements of campus security data management and user privacy protection.

The development process began with JSON database schema creation and evolved through iterative cycles of frontend development, backend logic implementation, and security feature integration. Each development phase included comprehensive testing procedures that validated functionality, performance, and security measures before proceeding to subsequent implementation stages. The systematic approach ensured that all components integrated effectively while maintaining data integrity and providing reliable campus security management capabilities.

The resulting system provides comprehensive security management functionality through intuitive web interfaces that enable users to report security incidents, manage incident tracking, monitor security patterns, and generate security reports. The implementation demonstrates successful integration of core web technologies to create a functional campus security management platform that meets professional standards for security, usability, and performance while remaining accessible through standard web hosting environments.

### 4.2 Database Implementation

The JSON file-based database implementation established the foundation for all security data operations through carefully designed data structures and optimized access patterns. The database schema creation process began with entity relationship modeling that identified the core data entities and their relationships, followed by file structure creation procedures that implemented appropriate data types, constraints, and validation for optimal performance and data integrity.

#### 4.2.1 Database Schema Creation

The database implementation created three primary JSON files that support comprehensive campus security management functionality while maintaining normalized data structures that prevent redundancy and ensure consistency. The users.json file stores account information including encrypted passwords and user preferences, implementing appropriate field validation and constraints that protect user data while supporting efficient authentication operations. The incidents.json file establishes comprehensive incident tracking with predefined categories and priority levels that provide consistent incident classification while allowing customization for specific security needs.

The incidents.json file serves as the central repository for security data, utilizing string data types for incident descriptions and implementing comprehensive metadata fields for temporal analysis. Date and timestamp fields support comprehensive temporal analysis while text fields accommodate incident descriptions and location information with appropriate length limits and character encoding support. Foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity between incidents and their associated users and categories.

Alert tables implement notification structures that support both immediate security alerts and comprehensive incident tracking with category-specific priorities. The alerts.json file establishes relationships between incidents and users while storing alert priorities and tracking incident resolution status. File-based indexing on frequently accessed data including user identifiers, date ranges, and incident categories optimizes data access performance for reporting and analysis operations.

#### 4.2.2 Data Relationships and Integrity

The JSON-based design implements comprehensive data validation constraints that maintain data consistency while supporting cascade operations for related record management. User deletion procedures automatically handle associated incident and alert removal through validation checks, preventing orphaned records while maintaining audit trail requirements. Incident modifications propagate appropriately to related alerts and notifications while preserving historical accuracy for completed security periods.

Data integrity enforcement prevents invalid data relationships while supporting legitimate data modification operations through carefully designed validation structures. Check constraints validate data ranges including valid date ranges, appropriate priority assignments, and proper incident type classifications. Automatic validation implementations maintain calculated fields and audit logs when incident data changes, ensuring that security summaries and progress indicators remain accurate without manual intervention.
